This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation and interpretation of a two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) model, commonly used for analyzing the effect of two categorical independent variables on a continuous dependent variable.

File
Two way annova model.ipynb
Purpose: This notebook performs a two-way ANOVA to understand how two independent categorical variables impact a dependent variable. 
It also explores interaction effects between the two factors.

Contents:
Data preprocessing and preparation.
Implementation of the two-way ANOVA model.
Analysis of main effects and interaction effects.
Interpretation and visualization of results to understand the significance and impact of each factor.

Requirements
Python 3.11
Jupyter Notebook

Required Libraries:
numpy
pandas
scipy.stats (for statistical testing)
statsmodels (for ANOVA modeling)
matplotlib and seaborn (for data visualization)

Description of Analysis
The two-way ANOVA model used in this notebook assesses:

Main Effects: The individual impact of each independent variable.
Interaction Effect: Whether the effect of one independent variable varies depending on the level of the other independent variable.
Results include p-values and F-statistics to determine the statistical significance of each effect.
